1) Politics Blogs       https://websites.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/


    Number of nodes: 1222
    Number of edges: 16717

A directed network of hyperlinks between weblogs on US politics. 
Political blogosphere Feb. 2005
Data compiled by Lada Adamic and Natalie Glance
Node "value" attributes indicate political leaning according to:
  0 (left or liberal)
  1 (right or conservative)
Data on political leaning comes from blog directories as indicated.  Some
blogs were labeled manually, based on incoming and outgoing links and posts
around the time of the 2004 presidential election.  Directory-derived
labels are prone to error; manual labels even more so.
Links between blogs were automatically extracted from a crawl of the front
page of the blog.
These data should be cited as Lada A. Adamic and Natalie Glance, "The
political blogosphere and the 2004 US Election", in Proceedings of the
WWW-2005 Workshop on the Weblogging Ecosystem (2005).
